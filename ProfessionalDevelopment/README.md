Throughout my time at SNHU, I have learned many aspects about computer science that I was not expecting to realize can help me further my development in the program, like learning how to program a basic AI model. I didn't have many chances at SNHU to be in a team environment since I was doing all of my work online, but I did have a major project that was team-based at my previous college that was designed for everyone to showcase what they knew in terms of each program offered. That project involved many aspects, including talking to stakeholders, data structures, databases, and cyber security measures to protect sensitive information.

The artifacts I selected demonstrate many aspects of my talents and abilities in programming. My first artifact was first designed as a prototype thermostat that could only control heat control. I upgraded the program by adding A/C control to further develop the prototype one step closer to full launch. It was fully programmed using C++ with Texas Instruments' CCS3220S launchpad. The second artifact I chose was designed in C++ for Software Reverse Engineering. The project was to reverse engineer a program from Assembly to C++. The enhancement I did was converting the program from C++ to Java, which I hadn't used in a few years. The third enhancement I completed was building an HTML/PHP front-end with a MySQL back-end. This allowed me to connect the front-end UI with the back-end database. I integrated three tables in the database together and used them to show the data on the front-end for users to access.
